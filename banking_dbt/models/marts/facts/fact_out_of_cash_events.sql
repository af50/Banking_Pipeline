--- Meds is going to  craete the fact table for out of cash events and this is the first trail for incremental load of fact table out of cash events.
-- but it's kinda complicated because we have to join with dim_error_type to get the error_type_key and also we have to join with dim_atm to get the atm_key and also we have to join with dim_date to get the date_key.
