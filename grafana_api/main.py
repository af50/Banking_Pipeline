"""
Lightweight FastAPI bridge between Grafana and DuckDB.
Grafana JSON datasource calls this API to query gold layer models.

Usage--from the project folder root:
uvicorn grafana_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload


Available endpoints:
    GET /                               Health check — confirms API and DuckDB connection are live.
    GET /dwh-info                       Available tables, their types and schemas.
    
    GET /atm-performance                Daily ATM metrics per terminal: transactions, success rate, OOC events, performance grade (A–D).
    GET /atm-performance/by-region      ATM metrics aggregated by governorate and performance grade — good for bar/map charts.
    GET /atm-performance/by-grade       ATM count and avg success rate grouped by grade A–D — good for pie charts.

    GET /replenishment                  Daily cash replenishment status per ATM: utilization %, urgency (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), OOC events.
    GET /replenishment/by-urgency       Replenishment urgency distribution across all ATMs — good for summary stat panels.

    GET /fraud-risk                     Full fraud risk profile per customer: score (0–100), risk level, dark web cards, fraud rate.
    GET /fraud-risk/summary             Fraud metrics aggregated by risk level, income segment, and age group — good for charts.

    GET /channel-comparison             Hourly channel metrics (ATM / Wallet / Card): transactions, amount, success rate, time of day.
    GET /channel-comparison/daily       Same metrics aggregated to daily level per channel — good for time-series charts.
    GET /channel-comparison/by-time     Channel performance broken down by time of day (MORNING/AFTERNOON/EVENING/NIGHT).

    GET /customer-spending              Full spending profile per customer: activity level, preferred category, online ratio, spend-to-income.
    GET /customer-spending/summary      Customer counts and avg spend aggregated by activity level, income segment, and category.

    GET /governorate-summary            Regional roll-up by Moroccan governorate: ATM count, transaction volume, OOC rate, wallet share.

    GET /pipeline-health                Last dbt run results: model/test name, status (success/error), duration, and failure count.
